**The content of the task**

Imagine a web application with a simple registration and login form (you may use Trello as a reference). Your task is to construct a feature test scenario for the following stories:

As a new user, I would like to register my account
As a user I would like to log in my account with my e-mail and password.

Remember to take into consideration all possible contexts, validation of credentials, fields and expected flash messages.

Out of the test scenarios that you prepared, automate 2 of them and provide us with their ready-to-run versions on repository of your choice (github, bitbucket etc). Please remember about including step by step instruction how to configure them in readme file.
